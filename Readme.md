# TinyVM

A simple register based virtual machine that uses a bytecode interpreter.

# Running

To run the VM, simply compile using CMake.

`cmake . -Bbuild; cd build; make`

This will work on Linux and macOS. If you were smart enough to install windows i'm sure you are smart enough to find your way around CMake too.
